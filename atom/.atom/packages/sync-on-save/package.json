  "readme": "# Sync-on-Save package for Atom\n\nThis package provides a save-time hook that bluntly does `add`, `commit` and `push` your changes to its Git repository. Sync-on-save allows you to use GitHub as a DropBox-like storage ... whose contents are mainly edited through Atom editor.\n\nYou can (and have to) enable the hook for each checkout that you want to \"sync\". There is a few commands to control the switch.\n\n * `Sync On Save: Enable Sync` to turn it on,\n * `Sync On Save: Disable Sync` to turn it off and\n * 'Sync On Save: Start Syncing' to force the sync.\n\nNote that the switch is saved as `.git/sync-on-save` file.\n\nThe sync can fail if there are conflicts. To make it work again, you can manually resolve the conflict.\n",
